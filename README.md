# graduator
The purpose of this app is to help students determine the most efficient way to fulfill all their course requirements.
So far, the app is in Alpha Version 1.0 (first working MVP)
Cannot be deployed through Heroku or GitHub web hosting:
  Must be cloned to hard drive and run through Gitbash:
    $ python master.py (for windows)
  Only works in Chrome.
  Make sure Selenium and Chromedriver are up to date.
  
Will continue to work on app after class is completed.
